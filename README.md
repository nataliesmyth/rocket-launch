# JavaScript Rocket Launch

Launch a rocket into space with this interactive web app

## Project Description

This is a small interactive web app with one goal: launch a rocket into space. If the launch is successful, the spaceship will pass the top of the webpage, or it will explode. All images are drawn by me using GIMP. The goal of this project was to practice the basics of JavaScript and practice creating original images using GIMP.
